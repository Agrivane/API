The 2Pro International API.

  - Upload via cURL (or browser) for images/audio/video/generic files/executables
  - Downloading using any web browser that supports downloads

To get started:
  - Copy some (or all) of the files out of Samples and customize config.php to suit. use other files as a template.


### Version
2.1.1 (Threshold 1)

### To Deploy
Easy. Reference config.php (which in turn references api.php) in your code. We've provided some sample functions for use. You'll also need the ionCube loader installed to use our API 

Watch this space. New functions coming soon :)
